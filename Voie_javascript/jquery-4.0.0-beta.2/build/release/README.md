# Releasing jQuery

This document describes the process for releasing a new version of jQuery. It is intended for jQuery team members and collaborators who have been granted permission to release new versions.

## Prerequisites

Before you can release a new version of jQuery, you need to have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS version)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Setup

1. Clone the jQuery repo:

	```sh
	git clone git@github.com:jquery/jquery.git
	cd jquery
	```

1. Install the dependencies:

	```sh
	npm install
	```

1. Log into npm with a user that has access to the `jquery` package.

	```sh
	npm login
	```

The release script will not run if not logged in.

1. Set `JQUERY_GITHUB_TOKEN` in the shell environment that will be used to run `npm run release`. The token can be [created on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=release-it) and only needs the `repo` scope. This token is used to publish GitHub release notes and generate a list of contributors for the blog post.

	```sh
	export JQUERY_GITHUB_TOKEN=...
	```

The release script will not run without this token.

## Release Process

1. Ensure all milestoned issues/PRs are closed, or reassign to a new milestone.
1. Verify all tests are passing in [CI](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/actions).
1. Run any release-only tests, such as those in the [`test/integration`](../../test/integration/) folder.
1. Ensure AUTHORS.txt file is up to date (this will be verified by the release script).

	- Use `npm run authors:update` to update.

1. Create draft blog post on blog.jquery.com; save the link before publishing. The link is required to run the release.

	- Highlight major changes and reason for release.
	- Add HTML from the `changelog.html` generated in the below release script.
	- Use HTML from the `contributors.html` generated in the below release script in the "Thanks" section.

1. Run a dry run of the release script:

	```sh
	BLOG_URL=https://blog.jquery.com/... npm run release -- -d
	```

1. If the dry run is successful, run the release script:

	```sh
	BLOG_URL=https://blog.jquery.com/... npm run release
	```

	This will run the pre-release script, which includes checking authors, running tests, running the build, and cloning the CDN and jquery-dist repos in the `tmp/` folder.

	It will then walk you through the rest of the release process: creating the tag, publishing to npm, publishing release notes on GitHub, and pushing the updated branch and new tag to the jQuery repo.

	Finally, it will run the post-release script, which will ask you to confirm the files prepared in `tmp/release/cdn` and `tmp/release/dist` are correct before pushing to the respective repos. It will also prepare a commit for the jQuery repo to remove the release files and update the AUTHORS.txt URL in the package.json. It will ask for confirmation before pushing that commit as well.

	For a pre-release, run:

	```sh
	BLOG_URL=https://blog.jquery.com/... npm run release -- --preRelease=beta
	```

	`preRelease` can also be set to `alpha` or `rc`.

	**Note**: `preReleaseBase` is set in the npm script to `1` to ensure any pre-releases start at `.1` instead of `.0`. This does not interfere with stable releases.

1. Once the release is complete, publish the blog post.

## Stable releases

Stable releases have a few more steps:

1. Close the milestone matching the current release: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/milestones. Ensure there is a new milestone for the next release.
1. Update jQuery on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content.
1. Update jQuery on https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com-theme.
1. Update latest jQuery version for [healthyweb.org](https://github.com/jquery/healthyweb.org/blob/main/wrangler.toml).
1. Update the shipping version on [jquery.com home page](https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com).

	```sh
	git pull jquery/jquery.com
	# Edit index.html and download.md
	git commit
	npm version patch
	git push origin main --tags
	```

1. Update the version used in [jQuery docs demos](https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/main/entries2html.xsl).

1. Email archives to CDNs.
